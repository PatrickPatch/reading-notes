## ***Growth Mindset***
Growth mindset is a perspective needed for **effective** learning.  Learning is in itself a learnable skill, but often for a variety of reasons people can get stuck and accept their current level of understanding as a limit.  There are many ways to adopt a Growth Mindset, much of which involve reframing limits.  These include:
* Embrace challenges as opportunities
* Learns from criticism
* Is inspired by the success of others
